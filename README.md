# DS2438 C-Library

This is a C library for interfacing with the DS2438 IC using the OneWire protocol on the Cortex M3 (CM3) microcontroller, specifically designed for the MDDS Board at HTL Hollabrunn.

## Hardware Connection

To use this library, make the following hardware connections:

- Connect pin PA0 of the CM3 to pin 8 (OneWire) of the DS2438.
- Connect GND and VCC appropriately to power the DS2438.

## Usage
See the [example](https://github.com/Persie0/DS2438_c-Lib/blob/master/main.c) in the GitHub repository for usage examples of the DS2438 C-Library.
